# Nature SDG influence tool

This tool provides a framework to identify the broad range of influences of
different built infrastructure sectors and natural ecosystems and their services
across various targets of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The tool provides evidence for decision-makers and practitioners on the direct
and indirect influences of various services across all SDG targets, as well as
an understanding of interdependencies between them.
